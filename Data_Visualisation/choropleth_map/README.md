# What I learned from doing this project

* I learned that because of the evolution of JavaScript, there is now a rather simple way to import multiple datasets to your d3.js project. I explored Promise.all() and use it to my advantage for this project.
* I learned about something called a geoPath() that is used together with choropleth maps.
* I learned that there are some build in ways in d3.js that allows you to create simple colourscales.
* I learned that while creating a very colourful map may look nice, using difference hues of the same colour actually makes for a better user experience.
* I learned about topojson that is used together with choropleth maps.
* I learned about the DOM-events event.pageX and event.pageY.
