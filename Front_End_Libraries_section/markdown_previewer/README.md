# What I learned while doing this project
* Like two thirds into the project I realised that I knew what Markdown was, because it is used on the Reddit site
* I learned about dangerouslySetInnerHTML, but not about any instance when it is actually good to use. From the React Docs I understood that it is called dangerouslySetInnerHTML to essentially stop the developer from using it.
* I learned about the Marked library and, after a lot of trial and error, that it isn't all that complicated to use.
