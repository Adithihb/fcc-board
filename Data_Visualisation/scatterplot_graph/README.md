# What I learned from doing this project

I did this simulataneously with the Bar Chart project because I just couldn't grasp the concept of d3.js. Therefore it follows that I learned pretty much the same things while doing this as I did with the Bar Chart. Some things were different though...

* I learned about the d3-specific function d3.json() that is used to fetch dynamic json data and transform it into a graph.
* I learned that there is a way to transform numbers in a string format to a number format using the timeParse() function.
* I learned that there are a ton of different options for formatting when using the timeFormat() function.
* I learned that not only is the g-element specific to svg, it also doesn't have a set position in the DOM, meaning that you'll always have to place it yourself.
* I learned how to create a mouseover-tooltip using d3-code.
* I learned about legends and their place in graphs.
