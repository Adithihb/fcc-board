            <h1 id="title">Livia Drusilla, The First Empress of the Roman Empire</h1>
            <p id="tribute-info">Livia Drusilla was born in during the first half of the first century B.C. Her first marriage
                yielded two children, Drusus and Tiberius, the latter later becoming the second emperor of Rome. The marriage 
                ended when Octavian, one of the three triumvirs - who were the victors of the civil war that raged after
                Caesar's assassination - and adoptive son of Julius Caesar, fell in love with her and demanded her hand in 
                marriage.
            </p>
            <p>Livia and Octavian - later Augustus - were married for roughly 50 years before Augustus died in 14 A.D., leaving
                Livia widowed. Livia lived on for many years until she eventually died in 27 A.D. During her life she lived 
                close to the ruling power for many years, first under her husband's reign and later during her son's.
            </p>
            <p>When Rome's fourth emperor, Claudius, came to power, Livia was deified to join her husband, who had been
                deified after his death. Naturally, since he was <em>divi filius</em> - son of a god - and thus godly
                himself.
            </p>
            <p>While we know comparatively little about Livia due to her being a woman, we do know that she made a huge
                impact on upper Roman society during her reign, with many artworks bearing witness of the style that
                Livia imposed on the empire as well as ancient historians witnessing her professional stance at her
                husband's side. A true Roman woman.
            </p>
            <h2>The shade of Robert Graves</h2>
            <p>Despite being one of the - if not <em>the</em> - most important women in history, Livia has gotten herself
            a bad reputation in common mouths because of a TV-series by Robert Graves - "I, Claudius". Graves did what one absolutely must
            not do as an historian and trusted a source completely without afterthought. The ancient Roman Suetonius has a
            lot to say about the Roman Imperial family and a lot of it shows his political stance as a senator <em>against</em>
            the Imperial family. In his work we can read about how Livia definitely poisoned Augustus' nephew Marcellus so
            that Tiberius could become emperor. She's also supposed to have killed Augustus' best friend and right-hand man
            Agrippa, before eventually growing tired of Augustus' long life and slaying him as well.</p>
            <p>There is just no proof of that. Marcellus died of a fever, along with many other Romans during those years, in
                a widespread epidemic. Agrippa died either of a fever or old age, or both. And Augustus was 74 years old when 
                he died, a very old man at the time and a man who had been sickly his whole life. Simply put, Livia is unjustly
                remember as an evil woman because of Suetonius and Robert Graves.
