# What I learned from doing this project

I didn't learn a lot of new things when doing this project really, as this was the last of the five and I used a lot of what I learned in previous projects for this one.

* I learned that d3.js has a built-in function called hierarchy() that is vital to creating a treemap diagram.
* I learned - while quite obvious really - that not all graphs/charts/diagrams need axes.
