# What I learned from doing this project
I feel like I took a great step forward with React by doing this one and I learned a lot, e.g.:
* I learned about the ref element and how it relates to using audio clips
** While trying to figure out how to do that, I also learned that there is something called react-audio-player, which would have made this project easier, but alas, the project tests required you to use the HTML5 audio element
* I learned about eventListeners and how to use them in React. I had encountered them before in Vanilla JS, but now I got to use them in REact as well
* I learned about the audio element in HTML5 and how to configure it for a proper user experience; ie. not just having a play button, but also that if you press the play button, the audio should start from the beginning
* I learned how to register and use keypresses with React
* I managed to confuse myself a lot about what the id of the audio element was and what the id of the buttom element was. I left it in the code rather than fixing it when I got the app to work, as a kind of reminder to myself
