# What I learned from these projects

Rather than having a specific file for each of these I figured I'd have a single one for all since the projects are quite simple. These projects are meant to be completed mostly without the use of JavaScript or any sort of framework.

* I learned about user stories and how to create a project following one and the restrictions that follow.
* I learned how to use the changePage()-function to simulate a Single Page Application.
* I learned how to use the window.onload()-function to have right elements load at start.
* I learned how to use ids of elements to create a better navigation within a page.
* I learned about the iframe-element that is used when embedding *e.g.* a Youtube-video on a webpage.
* I learned quite a bit about different ways to use CSS to accomplish what I want.

Obviously I also used quite a bit of other knowledge, but much if it I already knew before starting these projects.
