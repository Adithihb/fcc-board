# FreeCodeCamp_Projects
All projects on FreeCodeCamp that I've finished so far.

## Why?
For each section on FreeCodeCamp there are 5 projects to complete that will grant you a certification for that section.
I'm uploading my versions here to keep track of what I've done and to also keep some sort of record of what I've learnt completing these projects.
