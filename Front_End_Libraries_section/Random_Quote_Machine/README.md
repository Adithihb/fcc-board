# What I learned from doing this
I originally made this in pure Vanilla JavaScript, which was quite easily done, but then I realised a while after that it ought to be done in a Frontend framework, such as React (although React isn't really a framework...). Anyway, I learned:
* How to make myself a simple, local, api
* That even if it's just a constant holding an array that you're importing, you still need to "export default"
* How to use a part of the Twitter api to post something on Twitter.
* How to use Math.random() (yeah... that function really is more complicated in JS than in Python) to generate random quotes.
