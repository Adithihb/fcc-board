# What I learned from doing this project

This project took a long time to complete as it was my first step into the world of d3.js. As such, there was a long process of things I both had to grasp and also things that I figured out along the way. The list can get exhaustive because of that, but I really feel like I learnt a ton while doing this project, despite the frustration over it in the beginning.

* I learned how to use the standard fetch()-function to get data for the d3 project.
* I learned how to create a bottom x-axis and a left y-axis.
* I learned that you're not forced to have either of those, but also that you're not limited to two either, because there is also axes for top and right.
* I learned how to use the range() and domain() d3-specific functions to create a space for my graph.
* I learned that there is a function simply called nice(), that does just that, makes your graph look nicer by manipulating the axes/domain.
* I learned that there is something called tickformat() that can be used to modify what that ticks on your axes show.
* I learned about svg and about the svg-specific g-element.
* I learned about the structure of d3-commands; that there is .style, .append, .attr, .on and so on, as well as how they work together.
