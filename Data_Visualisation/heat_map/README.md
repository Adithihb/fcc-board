# What I learned from doing this project

First of all, I learned so much more from doing the Bar Chart and Scatterplot Graph than from this, but that's because those two introduced me to d3.js. Those two projects took me months of on and off work to complete, while this Heat Map took roughly two days, a huge difference.

* I learned about the concept of a Heat Map.
* I learned that there are loads of different usages of d3 and tons of examples available at d3js.org.
* I learned the concept of using the right colours for a graph. Some colours are harder to see and others work ill with each other. It is important to choose the right colours for your graph, not solely going by which colours "look nice".
* I learned that there are in fact quite a few different scales to work with in d3, before this I had used scaleLinear() and scaleTime()... and that was it.
* I learned that there are use cases in d3 where it isn't possible to use arrow functions because of the implicit return.
* I learned that there isn't a simple way to create a line-break inside of a text in d3. The easy (and ugly) solution is simple to create a second text element for the second row.
