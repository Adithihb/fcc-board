# What I learned from doing this project
* I think the biggest thing I learned from this was the importance of knowing before-hand what to do in the project, I had a rough idea from the beginning of how I wanted to build the app and what kind of functionality I was after
* Seemingly a minor thing, but I learned that to get minutes and seconds from a changing amount of minutes and seconds by using total minutes/60 to get the remaining minutes and total minutes % 60 to get the remaining seconds
* How to use Font Awesome icons, I had encountered them before, but hadn't really found a place where I wanted to implement them
* That using border-radius: 100% on a button element results in a very aesthetically pleasing element
* How to use states to automatically affect other states, without needing additional input from the user
* I learned that in React you cannot just pause a timer using setInterval like you would in Vanilla JS. In React, setInterval needs a variabel to hold that ID, otherwise it will just restart the timer at the default value
